This is a project looking at the Billboard Hot 100 song chart from 1958 - 2021. We look at song attributes pulled from Spotify's API, and build models to predict if a song will be a Number One Hit.

The data for this project was sourced from https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017
